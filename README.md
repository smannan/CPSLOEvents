# CPSLOEvents

This web application would help users organize community service events. Users can login and register then either create a new event and post it to an event listing, or can add an event to their calendar. Event pages will display the organizer, organizer contact information, location, date, and time. There will also be a page to view all events. Events that are private will only be shown to users who are invited. Events that are public will be shown to anyone. There will be a page where users can create a new event and invite other users via email. The web application may add a calendar tab so users can view which events they have added, but this is a reach milestone. If there is more time, we may add a search tool which allows users to search other sites for events nearby. Or, add a location tool, which only shows events close to a user. The web application would be geared towards organizing volunteers for the community, but could be used to organize other events as well.
